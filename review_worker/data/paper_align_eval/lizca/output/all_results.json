So why not replace step 2, and instead fine-tune the model using L_avg_group + L_alignment? Or even just train models from scratch with this loss. It would be good to compare to these. If CnC is simply more empirically successful than this alternative, then it would be good to see this.",

It would be good to see SupCon as a baseline in Table 1. This seems an important baseline, since the main idea of CnC is to pull items from the same class together in feature space, which is also done using SupCon.  The main (even only?) difference is the hard positive/negative sampling approach of CnC."

In particular, the assumption that \u201cthe loss function l(x; y) is 1-Lipschitz in x and bounded from above by one.\u201d seems to be necessary and simplify the proof a lot, but does not hold for typical losses like cross-entropy for classification and MSE for regression.",

To decouple it from the effect of wrong group prediction, it is important to compare in the setting where group labels are available, i.e., GDRO vs GDRO + contrastive.
