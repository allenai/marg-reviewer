            "The EATS model, particularly the aligner and decoder components, could benefit from a more detailed explanation. Consider including a section that provides a comprehensive description of the EATS model, including its architecture, training process, and unique features.",
            "To aid in understanding the model's structure and the flow of information, consider including a diagram illustrating the architecture of the EATS model. Additionally, consider including graphs or charts to visually represent the performance of the model.",
            "A detailed comparison with state-of-the-art models would be valuable. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of your approach in comparison to these existing models. A separate section or table that clearly outlines the differences and advantages of the EATS model over other models would be helpful.",
            "Additional experiments, such as testing on different datasets or using different evaluation metrics, could further validate your model. Please provide more detailed results of these experiments.",
            "A section discussing the limitations of the proposed model would provide valuable insights for future research. Discuss any limitations or potential drawbacks of the EATS model.",
            "Making your code and models available would increase the reproducibility of the results and allow other researchers to replicate your results and further build upon your work.",
            "A section on potential future work, including potential improvements to the model or other applications of the model that could be explored, would be beneficial.",
            "The missing equation in the 'ALIGNER LENGTH LOSS' section should be included to provide a complete understanding of the length loss calculation. Consider including the pseudocode or a brief overview of the soft DTW procedure in the main body of the paper.",
            "More information about the dataset used for training the models, including how it was collected, any preprocessing steps, and the rationale behind choosing this specific dataset, would be helpful.",
            "A discussion on how the specific hyperparameters were chosen and if any hyperparameter tuning was performed would provide more insight into the model's performance.",
            "A rationale for the choice of the spectrogram discriminator and a discussion of its advantages over other potential discriminators would be beneficial.",
            "More information on the choice of the phonemizer tool for text preprocessing and a discussion of its advantages over other potential text preprocessing tools would be helpful."
