The model is validated through a comprehensive set of experiments on ten benchmark datasets, and its performance is compared with nine baseline models, providing a robust evaluation. However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion on the limitations of the AdaGCCN model and potential future work. Additionally, the authors should address the issues with some datasets exceeding the GPU memory capacity or taking too much time in training.",
                "The paper acknowledges the computation cost introduced by the assistant module and the manual setting of the \u2206D list and the \u2206W list in the current AM as potential limitations. The authors propose deploying multiple workers to compute in parallel on a GPU to mitigate the computation cost and suggest that some hyper-parameters in AdaGCCN could be tuned for better model performance. However, it is not clear whether these solutions have been implemented or tested. It would be beneficial if the authors could provide more details about the implementation and testing of these solutions, or suggest future work to address these limitations. This would give readers a clearer understanding of the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed solutions, and the potential for improvement in future work.",
                "The paper would be significantly strengthened by a more detailed explanation of the \u2206D list and the \u2206W list in the current AM of the AdaGCCN. Specifically, it would be beneficial to understand the process by which these lists are determined, as they represent crucial changes in the depth and width of the model structure. Understanding this process would provide valuable insight into how these changes can impact the model's ability to express the features of graphs.",
                "While the paper discusses the use of parallel processing to alleviate computation overhead and provides some details on the scheduling strategy used to assign an appropriate number of workers, it would be helpful if the authors could provide more specific details on how the strategy determines the optimal number of workers. Understanding this aspect could provide more insight into the efficiency of the model and its scalability with respect to the number of workers.",
                "While the paper provides a comparison of AdaGCCN with other state-of-the-art models, it would be beneficial if the authors could delve deeper into the specific reasons why AdaGCCN outperforms these models on almost all datasets, and why it falls short on the PROTEINS dataset. A more detailed discussion on the impact of the complexity of inner graph relationships and the manual setting of the \u2206D list and the \u2206W list in the current AM on the model's performance would provide a more balanced view of the model's strengths and potential areas for improvement.",
                "The authors have justified their choice of CapsGNN as the base model and have shown that AdaGCCN outperforms CapsGNN and other baseline methods on various datasets. However, it would strengthen the argument for the novelty and significance of AdaGCCN if the authors could provide a comparative analysis against other GNN models that also use vector-based node embeddings. This would help validate the effectiveness of AdaGCCN's adaptive model architecture and its use of Reinforcement Learning.",
                "The paper assumes that the RL process in the assistant module will always find the optimal solution for adjusting the model architecture during training. However, there are several potential limitations of this process that are not discussed. For instance, the computational cost of the RL process could be significant, and it's unclear how the process would handle situations where there are multiple actions with the same maximal reward. The choice of reward function or the choice of state representation could also significantly affect the RL process. Additionally, the manual setting of the \u2206D list and the \u2206W list in the current AM could restrict the extraction ability of AdaGCCN. Discussing these limitations and how they could be addressed would significantly improve the paper.",

However, it lacks specific empirical evidence or theoretical analysis to support these claims. Providing empirical evidence, such as results from experiments that show the performance of the model with different depths and widths, would strengthen these claims. Additionally, a theoretical analysis that explains why the adaptive method works would also be beneficial. This would give readers a better understanding of the model and its performance.",
                "The paper proposes a parallel computation strategy that assumes the availability of a multi-core GPU with sufficient memory to handle multiple workers. This assumption could limit the applicability of the solution to systems with a single-core GPU, without a GPU, or with limited GPU memory or computational power. Discussing alternative strategies for these systems, or providing a more detailed analysis of the computational resources required for the proposed strategy, would improve the paper.",

However, it would be beneficial to provide a more detailed cost-benefit analysis to justify the assumption that the benefits of AdaGCCN outweigh its computational costs. Specifically, it would be helpful to include more quantitative data on the computational costs and how they are mitigated by the use of parallel computing on a GPU. This could include, for example, a comparison of the computational time of AdaGCCN with and without the use of parallel computing. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the trade-offs involved and strengthen the paper's significance.",

They also provide some empirical evidence showing that the model can extract more information in a highly efficient way when training graphs in different fields. However, it would be helpful if the authors could provide more empirical evidence, such as experimental results or comparative studies, to fully support their claims about the effectiveness of the proposed optimizations.",
                "The paper presents a novel solution, AdaGCCN, to address the limitations of GCNs. However, the assumptions underlying this solution could be better justified. For instance, the assumption that the assistant module in AdaGCCN evaluates the loss decrease speed and the accuracy on the validation fold, which helps to select the \u2206D and \u2206W with the biggest accumulated reward, lacks a detailed justification. Providing empirical evidence or a theoretical basis for this assumption would strengthen the paper.",
                "The proposed solution, AdaGCCN, is justified by its ability to adaptively adjust the model architecture and use vector-valued neurons. However, a more detailed comparison with other potential solutions would help to demonstrate its superiority. In particular, the paper could discuss potential limitations of AdaGCCN and alternative approaches.",
                "The trade-off analysis in the paper mainly focuses on the computational overhead of the assistant module in AdaGCCN. While the authors propose a parallel computing strategy to mitigate this, a more comprehensive analysis of other potential trade-offs would be beneficial. For example, the paper could discuss the impact on model interpretability or the feasibility of the parallel computing strategy in different computational environments. Additionally, the paper acknowledges that AdaGCCN's performance on the PROTEINS dataset is restricted due to the complexity of inner graph relationships and the manual setting of the \u2206D list and the \u2206W list in the current AM. A detailed analysis of this trade-off and potential ways to mitigate this limitation would improve the paper.",

However, the specific claim that scalar-valued neurons in GCNs can lead to latent information loss is not directly supported with specific theoretical or empirical evidence. It would be beneficial for the authors to provide more direct evidence or a more detailed explanation to support this claim. This could include theoretical justifications or empirical results demonstrating the limitations of scalar-valued neurons in GCNs, and how these limitations lead to latent information loss.",

However, a detailed formula for calculating the Q-value is not provided. This omission could make it difficult for readers to fully understand the model and reproduce the results. Specifically, the paper should provide the formula for calculating the Q-value, explain how it is updated under different conditions, and clarify how the update on Q(a t i) is determined whether a t i is chosen at epoch t \u2212 s (s is the length of the epoch sliding window). Providing these details would enhance the clarity and reproducibility of the paper.",

These details are said to be described in Table 1, but this table is not included in the parts of the paper that we have. Providing these details is crucial for understanding the experimental setup and for reproducing the experiments. Please ensure that Table 1 is included in the final version of the paper and that it provides detailed information about each of the ten datasets.",

This would not only allow readers to better understand the extent of AdaGCCN's performance and potential but also provide a more comprehensive evaluation of whether the paper meets its goals and supports its claims. The inclusion of such details would significantly enhance the paper's value by providing clearer practical implications and demonstrating the effectiveness of AdaGCCN.",

While it is mentioned that the authors reproduced a model for comparison, there is no clear indication of the availability of the code, data, or other resources used in the experiments. Providing this information is crucial for the scientific community to validate and build upon the findings. Therefore, the authors should include detailed information about the resources used and the steps taken to reproduce the experiments.",
                "The paper discusses the computational cost and efficiency of AdaGCCN and other models like GCNs, but it does not provide a direct comparison of these models. A direct comparison, including both time and space complexity, would be valuable for understanding the relative efficiency of AdaGCCN. This could involve comparing the time taken by AdaGCCN and other models to process the same datasets, as well as the GPU memory consumed by these models. This comparison is particularly important given that the paper introduces AdaGCCN as a model that simplifies the search space and eases the computation burden, and it would help to substantiate these claims.",
                "The paper should provide a more explicit list of the limitations of AdaGCCN. Specifically, it would be beneficial to discuss the additional computation overhead introduced by the assistant module, the potential restrictions caused by the manual setting of the \u2206D list and the \u2206W list, and the challenges faced when dealing with datasets that either exceed the GPU memory capacity or require excessive training time.

This is a significant contribution to the field, as it addresses the limitations of both methods and potentially offers a more efficient and robust solution for robot control tasks. Specifically, the algorithm is based on the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) algorithm and uses true gradients from a differentiable physical simulator to increase the convergence rate of both the actor and the critic. This approach allows the algorithm to maintain the robustness of DRL to local minima while also benefiting from the high sample efficiency of model-based methods. The algorithm also leverages differentiable simulation to improve the efficacy of learned critic models. The use of Advantage Estimation (AE) gradients allows for co-learning of critic value and gradient estimation, which improves the convergence of both actor and critic. Furthermore, the algorithm is applicable to a wider range of reward structures, unlike MPC which requires a differentiable reward. This makes the hybrid algorithm more versatile. The hybrid algorithm is more robust than MPC as it can generalize even when noise is added or initial conditions and tasks change, while MPC would require expensive replanning in these scenarios.

For instance, the paper could explore how additional communication resources could be utilized to improve the performance of the proposed methods if the communication link is not limited. It could also discuss different strategies for optimizing the decision-maker's policy in scenarios where the state distribution is not uniform.

In the practical coding scheme, it would be useful to elaborate on how KL-divergence is used to minimize the divergence between the representative \u00b5 j * and the original policy, and why this minimization is important. Similarly, in the formulation of the RC-CMAB problem, it would be beneficial to explain how KL-divergence measures the divergence between the sampling distribution Q and the target posterior probability \u03c0, and why this measurement is significant.

However, the explanation of the CNC method could be more detailed. Specifically, it would be beneficial to elaborate on the two-stage procedure of the CNC method. In the first stage, an Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) model is trained, which helps infer group information, i.e., spurious attributes. In the second stage, the aim is to improve representation alignment by 'pulling together' same-class datapoints and 'pushing apart' different-class datapoints, regardless of their individual groups or spurious features. This is achieved via supervised contrastive learning, using the heuristic that samples with the same ERM predictions exhibit similar spurious features (and vice versa). With a randomly sampled anchor, samples with the same class but different ERM predictions are selected as 'positives' to be pulled together, and samples from different classes but the same ERM prediction as hard 'negatives' to be pushed apart. Training a second model with this sampling scheme and supervised contrastive learning encourages this model to ignore spurious correlations that the initial ERM model learned, and improves representation alignment between same-class data points.

It would be beneficial if the authors could provide more information about how data subsampling is implemented as a strategy for budgeted training, its advantages and disadvantages compared to the proposed method, and its impact on the results.

Providing such details would strengthen the paper by giving readers a clearer understanding of the preprocessing steps and their significance.",
                "The paper provides a method that learns the type system, predicates, and high-level operators from pixel data, fitting well into the related literature. The method uses the DBSCAN clustering algorithm to partition options based on terminating states and an SVM with Platt scaling to estimate the preconditions for each partitioned option. However, the paper does not provide a detailed explanation or comparison of these specific methods with other potential methods. It would be beneficial for the reader to understand the rationale behind these choices. For instance, why was DBSCAN chosen for clustering over other algorithms? What advantages does it offer in this context? Similarly, why was an SVM with Platt scaling chosen for precondition estimation? How does it compare to other potential methods? Providing this information would strengthen the paper by giving the reader a better understanding of the method's design choices.",
                "The authors have demonstrated the application of their object-centric representation learning approach to Minecraft tasks and a Crafting domain. The evidence provided, such as the successful application of the method to these diverse tasks/domains, the reduction in the number of samples required to learn a model for a new task over time, and the decrease in the number of new operators that must be learned as the number of tasks increases, supports the generalizability of the method. However, to further strengthen the claim of generalizability, the authors could consider applying their method to tasks or domains that do not share the same types of objects. This would provide a more robust test of the method's ability to generalize across different contexts, which is crucial for reducing the amount of new learning required when applying the learned model to new tasks.",
                "The paper presents a novel approach to learning PPDDL operators from raw data, which are used to represent high-level actions in a given environment. However, the evaluation of these operators seems to be based on their ability to accurately represent the actions and their effects in the environment, and their transferability across different tasks, without a specific metric or method for measuring their quality. For a more objective evaluation of the PPDDL operators, it would be beneficial to propose a specific metric that quantifies the accuracy of the operators in predicting the outcomes of actions, and measures the reduction in learning time when these operators are transferred to new tasks. Another possible metric could be the efficiency of the planning process, such as the number of steps or the amount of time it takes for the agent to plan and execute a task using the PPDDL operators. These metrics would provide a more objective measure of the quality of the PPDDL operators and would allow for a more rigorous evaluation of the proposed approach. This would not only strengthen the current work but also provide a benchmark for future research in this area.",

While the paper mentions that the proposed method was demonstrated on a 2D crafting domain and a series of Minecraft tasks, it does not provide explicit details about how the effectiveness of the method was evaluated. It would be helpful if the authors could conduct experiments that specifically test the transferability of the abstractions across different tasks and domains, and provide a detailed description of the evaluation method used. This would make the results more convincing and allow other researchers to replicate the experiments.",
                "The authors have chosen tasks that appear to be representative of the range the method is intended to handle, and there is a discussion on how the results might generalize to other tasks. However, the justification for the choice of tasks and the discussion on generalizability are largely speculative and lack empirical evidence. The authors should provide more concrete evidence or examples to support their claims. For instance, they could include additional experiments or analyses that demonstrate the method's performance on a wider variety of tasks, or they could provide a more detailed explanation of why the chosen tasks are representative and how the results might generalize.",

This would allow for a more objective evaluation of their claim and enhance the clarity and credibility of the paper.",

Furthermore, the paper does not provide a clear, step-by-step breakdown of the process, specifics of the preprocessing steps to reduce the dimensionality of the state space, and a detailed explanation of how the DBSCAN clustering algorithm and SVM are applied in the context of their work.

It would be beneficial to include quantitative measures such as the number of samples required to learn a new task, the speed at which the agent is able to construct plans composed of low-level actions in new tasks, the number of new operators that need to be learned when transferring to a new task, and the success rate of the agent in completing new, unseen tasks using the learned abstractions.

The method involves learning the type system, predicates, and high-level operators. However, the paper lacks explicit details about how this learning from pixel data is done. Providing more details about this process would help readers understand the method better and appreciate its potential applications. For instance, it would be helpful to know how the agent partitions the options and fits a classifier to each partition's initiation states, and a density estimator to its terminating states. It would also be beneficial to understand how the agent generates a propositional PDDL using these learned preconditions and effects, and how it lifts its representation by replacing the learned propositions with predicates parameterised by the determined object types. Lastly, it would be useful to know how the agent performs problem-specific instantiation.",

This would help readers better understand the challenges and limitations of the method.",
                "The paper should provide more details about the quality of the PPDDL operators. Specifically, it would be beneficial to discuss how the precondition classifier and the effect density estimator are learned from the option execution data, and what measures are taken to ensure their accuracy. This is important because inaccuracies in these components could lead to incomplete or incorrect representations of the task, affecting the agent's ability to plan and execute tasks efficiently. Furthermore, the paper should elaborate on how errors in learning can result in imperfect operators. For instance, if the agent incorrectly estimates the effect distribution for an option, it could lead to an inaccurate representation of the possible states the agent could end up in after executing that option. This could result in the agent making suboptimal or even incorrect decisions during planning. Similarly, errors in learning the precondition could lead to the agent incorrectly believing that it can execute an option in a state where it actually cannot, or vice versa. By providing more details on these aspects, readers will gain a better understanding of the potential issues and how they can be addressed.",

Hyperparameters: While some hyperparameters are specified for the Crafting domain, the paper should provide all hyperparameters used in all tasks. This includes the hyperparameters used in the Blocks World task, the 2D crafting environment, the Minecraft task, and the inter-task transfer in Minecraft. 2.

                "The paper presents a comparison with a transformer-based attention aligner baseline in section 'G TRANSFORMER-BASED ATTENTION ALIGNER BASELINE', but it does not discuss the potential limitations of this approach. Discussing the limitations, such as computational complexity, scalability, or performance under certain conditions, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the model and its applicability. This would be beneficial for others attempting to replicate the results or extend the model."
