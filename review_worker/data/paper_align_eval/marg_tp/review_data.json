It would be helpful to provide a more layman-friendly explanation of how N-CODE increases the expressivity of continuous-time neural nets by using tools from control theory, how it learns a family of vector fields parameterized by data, and how the transformation of the input space is no longer constrained to be a homeomorphism, allowing the system to easily 'tear' apart the two annulus classes without directly lifting the data space to a higher dimension.",

            "The section on open and closed-loop controllers is a bit confusing. It might be helpful to provide more context or examples to help readers understand these concepts.

This allows for particle trajectories to evolve more freely than within a single flow that must account for the whole data-distribution. In contrast, in closed-loop control, a differentiable mapping g outputs the time-dependent control weights \u03b8(t) given the state of the variable x(t), resulting in a module describing a time-varying transformation \u03a6\u03b8(t)(x0, t).

            "The training section is well-written and provides a clear explanation of how N-CODE is trained.

For instance, the paper could explain how the generalized loss function integrates a cost over some interval [0, T], allowing for a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance over the entire trajectory, not just the final state of the system. This loss formulation is more general than in previous works as it can be any Lebesgue-measurable function, encompassing discrete time point penalization or regularization of activations or weights over the whole trajectory. Additionally, the paper could discuss why the parameters of the encoder and decoder module were trained for minimizing the mean-squared error (MSE) on CIFAR-10 and CelebA datasets, or alternatively the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the data distribution and the output of the decoder for the MNIST dataset. The choice of loss function is likely due to the nature of the task, which involves image autoencoding and generation. MSE is a common loss function for regression problems, and it measures the average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual value. On the other hand, the Kullback-Leibler divergence measures how one probability distribution diverges from a second, expected probability distribution, which is suitable for tasks involving probability distributions such as in the case of the MNIST dataset."

            "The paper discusses value bounds and expected error bounds in sections B.1 and B.2, but it's unclear how these concepts relate to the overall goals of the research. Providing more context or explanation would help readers understand the implications of these results. The paper provides theoretical analysis and proofs for the HiP-MDP and HiP-BMDP settings, showing improvements in sample complexity over prior work, but it does not clearly explain how these results relate to the overall goals of the research.",
            "The conclusion does a good job of summarizing the findings of the paper, but it could benefit from a more explicit discussion of the implications of these findings for future research. The paper concludes by advocating for the HiP-BMDP framework to address the multi-task reinforcement learning setting and discusses potential future work, but it could provide a more explicit discussion of these points.",
            "The paper mentions several different algorithms and techniques, but it does not always clearly explain how these are related to each other and to the overall goals of the research. This could be clarified in the conclusion or in a separate section. The paper discusses several different algorithms and techniques, including HiP-BMDP, HiP-MDP, Distral, PCGrad, GradNorm, and others, but it does not always provide a clear explanation of how these are related to each other and to the overall goals of the research."
