- Improve the transition from the Stable Rank Normalization section to the Experiments section with a brief introductory paragraph.
- In the Experiments section, provide more details about the experimental setup, such as the hardware used, the duration of the experiments, and any preprocessing steps applied to the datasets.

2024-11-14 20:19:21 [INFO] (__main__):  FINAL REVIEW:
- The abstract provides a good overview of the paper. However, it would be beneficial to include a brief mention of the key results or findings of the paper to give readers a sense of the impact and significance of the work.
- The introduction does a good job of setting the context and explaining the motivation for the work. However, it could be improved by providing a clearer statement of the problem that the paper addresses.
- The methodology section is detailed and provides a good explanation of the Learned Belief Search (LBS) method. However, it would be helpful to include a more explicit comparison of LBS with other existing methods, highlighting the unique features and advantages of LBS.
- The paper mentions the results of applying LBS to the benchmark problem of two-player Hanabi self-play. However, it would be beneficial to include more detailed discussion of these results, including any limitations or potential areas for future work.
- Please ensure that all figures and equations are included in the final version of the paper and that they are clearly labeled and referenced in the text.
- The paper cites a number of previous works. However, it would be helpful to provide a more detailed discussion of how this work builds on or differs from these previous studies.
- The paper could benefit from a conclusion section that summarizes the main findings, discusses the implications of the work, and suggests directions for future research. It would also be beneficial to provide a brief discussion on the potential challenges and benefits of these future directions.
- The paper uses a number of technical terms and acronyms. It would be helpful to define these terms when they are first introduced to make the paper more accessible to a broader audience.
- In some sections, the writing is dense and could be clarified.

While these questions are interesting and relevant, it would be helpful if the authors could provide more direct answers to these questions in the subsequent sections. The current structure leaves the reader to infer the answers from the presented data and discussions.
- The authors should consider providing more context or explanation for the terms and concepts used in the paper. For instance, terms like 'Attack S', 'Attack P', 'Attack D', and 'Attack R' are used frequently but their meanings or the specific methods they refer to are not clearly explained.
- In paragraph 103, the authors present a table of results but do not provide a clear explanation or discussion of these results. It would be beneficial to include a paragraph discussing these results in detail, explaining what they mean and their implications for the study.
- In the 'Experiment setup' section, the authors provide a detailed description of the experimental setup. However, it would be beneficial to include a brief rationale or justification for the chosen setup. For instance, why were specific datasets chosen? Why were certain models used for certain attacks?
- The 'Related Works' section provides a comprehensive overview of the existing literature. However, it would be beneficial to include a brief discussion on how the current study builds upon or differs from these existing works.
- The explanation of the simulation of the DP adversary could be more explicit. It would be beneficial to provide a more detailed explanation of how this simulation works and why it is important for removing the effects of other points in the dataset.
- The authors mention 'type I and type II errors' without providing any context or explanation. It would be helpful to briefly define these terms for readers who may not be familiar with them.
- The authors should consider adding a brief summary of the main findings from the referenced works (Jagielski et al., 2020; Nasr et al., 2021; Malek et al., 2021). This would provide the reader with a better understanding of the context and significance of the current study.
- The authors have included links without any accompanying text or explanation. It would be helpful to provide a brief description of what each link is for and how it relates to the study. For example, are these links to datasets used in the study, to related works, or to tools used in the analysis? Providing this context would make it easier for readers to understand the relevance of these links.
- The authors should ensure that all links are correctly formatted and functional. The link in paragraph 146 appears to have a space in it, which could prevent it from working correctly.
- A conclusion summarizing the main findings, their implications, and potential future work would be a valuable addition to the paper.
- Ensure all references are correctly cited in the text and listed in the reference section.
- The authors mention an appendix with additional information. Make sure this is included in the final version of the paper and properly referenced in the text.
- Overall, the paper could benefit from a thorough proofreading to correct minor typographical errors and improve sentence structure.
